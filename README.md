# Image Caption Generator

This project is an Image Caption Generator using deep learning techniques on the Flickr8k dataset. The system generates textual descriptions for images by combining computer vision and natural language processing.

## Overview

The goal is to create an AI model capable of understanding images and producing accurate and coherent textual descriptions. The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text generation.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, which comprises a collection of images along with corresponding textual descriptions. The dataset is structured to have images in one directory and textual descriptions in a separate file, allowing for seamless processing.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Images are preprocessed using an InceptionV3 model, while textual descriptions are cleaned, tokenized, and converted into sequences.

2. **Feature Extraction:** Image features are extracted using the InceptionV3 model, creating a representation of visual content.

3. **Text Processing:** Captions are indexed, tokenized, and embedded using pre-trained GloVe word embeddings to understand textual context.

4. **Model Architecture:** A neural network architecture combines image features and textual data. LSTM layers capture sequential information while dense layers aid in prediction.

5. **Training:** The model is trained on prepared data, optimizing to predict appropriate captions for images. Training involves parameter optimization and minimizing prediction errors.

6. **Caption Generation:** Post-training, the model generates captions for new images based on their visual features.

## Usage

1. **Requirements:** Ensure the necessary libraries and dependencies are installed (`requirements.txt` provided).
   
2. **Dataset Preparation:** Organize the Flickr8k dataset with images in one directory and textual descriptions in a separate file as described in the project structure.

3. **Code Execution:** Modify paths in the code to match your local dataset structure. Run the code to train the model and generate captions.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the synergy between computer vision and natural language processing, showcasing the potential of AI systems in understanding and describing visual content.
